After following the instructions in https://github.com/maho3/ltu-ili/blob/main/INSTALL.md up until running the example in examples/example_inference_sbi.py. I am using a fresh venv in python 3.10 for this.

ltu-ili was installed with pip install -e .[sbi] (ie no delfi backend)

1) When importing ili-summarizer, pycorr is not found even though I ran pip install pycorr.
This is because there are at least two repos and using pip install refers to the wrong one for our case.
- https://github.com/MavericksDS/pycorr/tree/master
- https://py2pcf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/building.html

The correct one is the second one. Note that nbodykit in ili-summarizer dependencies requires Corrfunc, but pycorr requires to uninstall Corrfunc and then to install a specific fork of the latter: Does it impede dependencies with nbodykit?

2) camb and emcee were not in ltu-ili dependencies (pip install camb and emcee) but are needed

3) from ili.dataloaders import ... : did not work initially because almost all subdirectories in ltu-ili that are intended to be packages lack a proper __init__py file, including the parent ltu-ili/ili.
As a side note, even if the "parent of parent" ltu-ili is not intended to be imported, we should avoid dashes in names.

After some modifications, I was able to run example_inference_sbi.py.

4) In my current __init__ in ili/inference, I ignore the delfi related files. This should be handled for the future (eg __init__.py with conditions based on option sbi/delfi?)
