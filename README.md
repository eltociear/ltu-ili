=======

The [Simons Collaboration on Learning the Universe](https://www.learning-the-universe.org/) Implicit Likelihood Inference (LtU-ILI) pipeline is a framework for applying simulation-based inference methods to constrain posteriors on cosmological parameters using astronomical survey data. The code is currently built to analyze spectroscopic surveys of the universe's Large-Scale Structure (LSS), such as SDSS-BOSS.

Parts of the ILI pipeline are being developed in forked repositories such as [ili-summarizer](https://github.com/florpi/ili-summarizer).
